**Accountability is hard when there is no boss.**

For the past year I've been working on several projects - some team based, some personal. What I've come to notice, is that keeping focus on projects is super tricky. How do I make sure I'm making **progress** on a project, how do I know I'm spending time on the **right** **areas** of the project, and how do I know I'm working on some **useful**?

In the world of corporate bureaucracy, there is always someone you'r accountable to - they call it your boss. 

In the world of personal projects however, how does one actually keep accountable to what he's doing? Who do I report to when a new feature is built, or when marketing doesn't go so well. It is my hope that as I write about the work I do, it'll help me reflect and keep myself **accountable** to them.

**Sharing, even with yourself, is caring.**

This is aimed to be a personal blog, not one to gather readers. What it is instead is that it is a platform where I want to share thoughts and ideas. There is a wise saying from a mentor of mine, to write an idea down when it comes to mind, and then leave it for a week. When the week is over, come back to it - only then with a clear mind and unbiased heart can one judge whether an idea is good. So this will be a platform for that, a place to keep my ideas and thoughts.
